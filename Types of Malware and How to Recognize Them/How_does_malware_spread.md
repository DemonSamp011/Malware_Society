There are six common ways that malware spreads:

    Vulnerabilities: A security defect in software allows malware to exploit it to gain unauthorized access to the computer, hardware or network
    Backdoors: An intended or unintended opening in software, hardware, networks or system security
    Drive-by downloads: Unintended download of software with or without knowledge of the end user
    Homogeneity: If all systems are running the same operating system and connected to the same network, the risk of a successful worm spreading to other computers is increased
    Privilege escalation: A situation where an attacker gets escalated access to a computer or network and then uses it to mount an attack
    Blended threats: Malware packages that combine characteristics from multiple types of malware making them harder to detect and stop because they can exploit different vulnerabilities
