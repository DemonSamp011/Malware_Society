# SlothFul-Malware

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) have identified a malware variant — referred to as 
***SLOTHFULMEDIA**** — used by a sophisticated cyber actor. In addition, U.S. Cyber Command has released the malware sample to the malware aggregation tool and repository, VirusTotal.

CISA and CNMF are distributing this Malware Analysis Report (MAR) to enable network defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested response actions 
and recommended mitigation techniques.

The sample is a dropper, which deploys two files when executed. The first is a remote access tool (RAT) named ‘mediaplayer.exe’’, which is designed for command and control (C2) of 
victim computer systems. Analysis has determined the RAT has the ability to terminate processes, run arbitrary commands, take screen shots, modify the registry, and modify files on 
victim machines. It appears to communicate with its C2 controller via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

# Racoon-Malware

A Reason Labs research team has discovered a new variant of the Raccoon malware family. Initially discovered back in 2019, the Raccoon malware family is used to steal confidential data and browser information.

According to the Reason Security report, the new variant masquerades itself as legit, known program installers. The new malware sample flew under the AV radar, says the team, and there were only three minimal detections over two weeks ago. In this article, we analyze this new variant, its attack methods, and disguise techniques. 

The Raccoon malware family is a Trojan that steals user data from about 60 browsers, as well as credentials from various cryptocurrency wallets and the trojan is capable of taking screenshots from the victim machine and capturing input, explains the team. 

The first versions seen, ITW, were written in C++, but a year has gone by and the malware authors have since developed new versions written in Borland Delphi, apparently to make it harder to detect and analyze. The malware comes inside an Inno Setup installer that is responsible for installing both the original program and the malware.

# Clop Ransomware

Ransomware is malware which encrypts your files until you pay a ransom to the hackers. “Clop” is one of the latest and most dangerous ransomware threats. It’s a variant of the well-known CryptoMix ransomware, which frequently targets Windows users.

Before beginning the encryption process, the Clop ransomware blocks over 600 Windows processes and disables multiple Windows 10 applications, including Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials — leaving you with zero chance of protecting your data.

The Clop ransomware has evolved since its inception, now targeting entire networks — not just individual devices. Even the Maastricht University in the Netherlands became a victim of the Clop ransomware, with almost all Windows devices on the university’s network being encrypted and forced to pay a ransom.

# Fake Windows Updates (Hidden Ransomware)

Hackers have been increasingly sending emails that instruct readers to install urgent Windows OS updates. The emails trick readers into installing the “latest” Windows updates, which are actually ransomware ‘.exe’ files in disguise.

The ransomware contained in these emails is known as “Cyborg”. It encrypts all of your files and programs and demands a ransom payment to un-encrypt the files.

Unfortunately, many email service providers and basic antivirus software aren’t able to detect and block these emails. This is why you must be using an antivirus that provides proper internet security, protecting you from dangerous emails.

# New Update

Dropped – Malware delivered by other malware already on the system, an exploit kit, infected third-party software, or manually by a cyber threat actor. Currently Gh0st is being dropped.

Multiple – Malware that currently favors at least two vectors. ZeuS, CryptoWall, and CoinMiner are currently utilizing multiple vectors. ZeuS is dropped by other malware, but it is also delivered via malvertisement. CoinMiner utilizes the malspam and dropped vectors.

Malspam – Unsolicited emails, which either direct users to malicious web sites or trick users into downloading or opening malware. Top 10 Malware using this technique Dridex, Kovter, NanoCore, Pushdo, Tinba, and Ursnif.

    Dridex is a banking trojan that uses malicious macros in Microsoft Office with either malicious embedded links or attachments. 
    Dridex is disseminated via malspam campaigns.
    
    ZeuS is a modular banking trojan which uses keystroke logging to compromise victim credentials when the user visits a banking 
    website. Since the release of the ZeuS source code in 2011, many other malware variants have adopted parts of it’s codebase, 
    which means that events classified as ZeuS may actually be other malware using parts of the ZeuS code.
    
    Kovter is a fileless click fraud malware and a downloader that evades detection by hiding in registry keys. Reporting indicates 
    that Kovter can have backdoor capabilities and uses hooks within certain APIs for persistence.
    
    Gh0st is a RAT used to control infected endpoints. Gh0st is dropped by other malware to create a backdoor into a device that 
    allows an attacker to fully control the infected device.
    
    CryptoWall is a ransomware commonly distributed through malspam with malicious ZIP attachments, Java Vulnerabilities, and 
    malicious advertisements. Upon successful infection, CryptoWall will scan the system for drive letters, network shares, and 
    removable drives. CryptoWall runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
    
    Pushdo is a botnet that has been active since 2007 and operates as a service for malware and spam distribution. Pushdo is 
    known to distribute the Cutwail spambot. The malware uses encrypted communication channels and domain generation algorithms 
    to send instructions to its zombie hosts.
    
    NanoCore is a RAT spread via malspam as a malicious Excel XLS spreadsheet. As a RAT, NanoCore can accept commands to 
    download and execute files, visit websites, and add registry keys for persistence.
    
    Tinba (aka Tiny Banker) is a banking trojan, known for its small file size. Tinba uses web injection to collect victim 
    information from login pages and web forms and is primarily disseminated via exploit kits.
    
    Ursnif, and its variant Dreambot, are banking trojans known for weaponizing documents. Ursnif recently upgraded its 
    web injection attacks to include TLS callbacks in order to obfuscate against anti-malware software. Ursnif collects 
    victim information from login pages and web forms.
    
    CoinMiner is a cryptocurrency miner that uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and EternalBlue to spread 
    across a network. CoinMiner uses the WMI Standard Event Consumer scripting to execute scripts for persistence. 
    CoinMiner spreads through malspam or is dropped by other malware.
