Identified Jan. 22 in the Google Play mobile application store by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, DroidCleaner is 
marketed by attackers as an app that can free memory on Google's operating system.

The malware takes aim at Android smart phones, as well as PCs. DroidCleaner compromises a mobile device's SD card 
and contacts list and can even send, delete and upload SMS/text messages. Once a user connects an infected device 
to a PC, DroidCleaner infects the computer and hijacks the system's microphone for eavesdropping.

"The most concerning thing is the fact that bad guys are using the infected smart phones as a new attack vector, 
aiming to infect the PC," says Kaspersky researcher Fabio Assolini. "This is a completely new behavior on malicious 
Droid apps."

The malware's ability to record audio from an infected PC means anytime the PC's microphone is activated, every 
sound could be recorded, Assolini says. DroidCleaner, however, is not a malware designed specifically for attacks 
against online-banking.

But the malware has the ability to compromise SMS/texting features often used for out-of-band authentication or 
verification of online-banking transactions. And any attack against a mobile platform, especially one that can 
hijack SMS/texting services, poses a risk, Assolini says.

"Online banking using mobile devices is targeted by other known malicious viruses, such as Zeus, SpyEye and Carberp," he says. 
"The attacks on the Android platform are very common, but with different goals. [This is why] we advise all users 
to maintain an AV on their device."

PCs running older versions of the Microsoft Windows operating systems are vulnerable, Kaspersky researchers point 
out. The function that automatically allowed the malware to be installed has been disabled on current versions, 
they note. So the PC piece of the attack is aimed only at users using older versions of Windows.
