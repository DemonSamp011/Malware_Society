# SlothFul-Malware

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) have identified a malware variant — referred to as 
***SLOTHFULMEDIA**** — used by a sophisticated cyber actor. In addition, U.S. Cyber Command has released the malware sample to the malware aggregation tool and repository, VirusTotal.

CISA and CNMF are distributing this Malware Analysis Report (MAR) to enable network defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested response actions 
and recommended mitigation techniques.

The sample is a dropper, which deploys two files when executed. The first is a remote access tool (RAT) named ‘mediaplayer.exe’’, which is designed for command and control (C2) of 
victim computer systems. Analysis has determined the RAT has the ability to terminate processes, run arbitrary commands, take screen shots, modify the registry, and modify files on 
victim machines. It appears to communicate with its C2 controller via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

# Racoon-Malware

A Reason Labs research team has discovered a new variant of the Raccoon malware family. Initially discovered back in 2019, the Raccoon malware family is used to steal confidential data 
and browser information.

According to the Reason Security report, the new variant masquerades itself as legit, known program installers. The new malware sample flew under the AV radar, says the team, and there 
were only three minimal detections over two weeks ago. In this article, we analyze this new variant, its attack methods, and disguise techniques. 

The Raccoon malware family is a Trojan that steals user data from about 60 browsers, as well as credentials from various cryptocurrency wallets and the trojan is capable of taking screenshots 
from the victim machine and capturing input, explains the team. 

The first versions seen, ITW, were written in C++, but a year has gone by and the malware authors have since developed new versions written in Borland Delphi, apparently to make it harder 
to detect and analyze. The malware comes inside an Inno Setup installer that is responsible for installing both the original program and the malware.
