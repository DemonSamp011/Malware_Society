# Binder 
    It is used to bind or collaborate the server and virus that has been created. So if anyone opens the image or songs to get open
    and start working in background.
    
# Crypter
    It basically a tool used for changing binary code of the .exe files and applies many encryptions on it to make it undetectable.

#	Zipping
    In this method you have to put your server and virus and make it in a zip file, it will change extension from .exe to .zip 
    which bypasses the file transfer facility.
    {Note: Using WinRAR provides that file with a password and antivirus wonâ€™t be able to detect it.}

#	Extension
    It basically changes the extension of the file from .exe or .bat file to .png, .jpg, .jpeg and etc. and then sends it to the user 
    but the user need to rename the extension to .exe file for the virus/server to perform.
