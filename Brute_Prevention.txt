# BPS ERROR LOGGING AND TRACKING
# Use BPS Custom Code to modify/edit/change this code and to save it permanently.
# BPS has premade 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed and
# 410 Gone template logging files that are used to track and log 400, 403, 404, 405 and 410 errors
# that occur on your website. When a hacker attempts to hack your website the hackers IP address,
# Host name, Request Method, Referering link, the file name or requested resource, the user agent
# of the hacker and the query string used in the hack attempt are logged.
# All BPS log files are htaccess protected so that only you can view them.
# The 400.php, 403.php, 404.php, 405.php and 410.php files are located in /wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/
# The 400, 403, 405 and 410 Error logging files are already set up and will automatically start logging errors
# after you install BPS and have activated BulletProof Mode for your Root folder.
# If you would like to log 404 errors you will need to copy the logging code in the BPS 404.php file
# to your Theme's 404.php template file. Simple instructions are included in the BPS 404.php file.
# You can open the BPS 404.php file using the WP Plugins Editor or manually editing the file.
# NOTE: By default WordPress automatically looks in your Theme's folder for a 404.php Theme template file.
