Dropped 
    Malware delivered by other malware already on the system, an exploit kit, infected third-party software, or manually by a cyber threat actor. Currently Gh0st is being           dropped.

Multiple
    Malware that currently favors at least two vectors. ZeuS, CryptoWall, and CoinMiner are currently utilizing multiple vectors. ZeuS is dropped by other malware, but it is         also delivered via malvertisement. CoinMiner utilizes the malspam and dropped vectors.

Malspam
    Unsolicited emails, which either direct users to malicious web sites or trick users into downloading or opening malware. Top 10 Malware using this technique Dridex, Kovter,     NanoCore, Pushdo, Tinba, and Ursnif.

Dridex 
    It is a banking trojan that uses malicious macros in Microsoft Office with either malicious embedded links or attachments. 
    Dridex is disseminated via malspam campaigns.
    
ZeuS 
    It is a modular banking trojan which uses keystroke logging to compromise victim credentials when the user visits a banking 
    website. Since the release of the ZeuS source code in 2011, many other malware variants have adopted parts of itâ€™s codebase, 
    which means that events classified as ZeuS may actually be other malware using parts of the ZeuS code.
    
Kovter 
    It is a fileless click fraud malware and a downloader that evades detection by hiding in registry keys. Reporting indicates 
    that Kovter can have backdoor capabilities and uses hooks within certain APIs for persistence.
    
Gh0st 
    It is a RAT used to control infected endpoints. Gh0st is dropped by other malware to create a backdoor into a device that 
    allows an attacker to fully control the infected device.
    
CryptoWall 
    It is a ransomware commonly distributed through malspam with malicious ZIP attachments, Java Vulnerabilities, and 
    malicious advertisements. Upon successful infection, CryptoWall will scan the system for drive letters, network shares, and 
    removable drives. CryptoWall runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
    
Pushdo 
    It is a botnet that has been active since 2007 and operates as a service for malware and spam distribution. Pushdo is 
    known to distribute the Cutwail spambot. The malware uses encrypted communication channels and domain generation algorithms 
    to send instructions to its zombie hosts.
    
NanoCore 
    It is a RAT spread via malspam as a malicious Excel XLS spreadsheet. As a RAT, NanoCore can accept commands to 
    download and execute files, visit websites, and add registry keys for persistence.
    
Tinba (aka Tiny Banker)
    It is a banking trojan, known for its small file size. Tinba uses web injection to collect victim 
    information from login pages and web forms and is primarily disseminated via exploit kits.
    
Ursnif    
    Ursnif and its variant Dreambot, are banking trojans known for weaponizing documents. Ursnif recently upgraded its 
    web injection attacks to include TLS callbacks in order to obfuscate against anti-malware software. Ursnif collects 
    victim information from login pages and web forms.
    
CoinMiner 
    It is a cryptocurrency miner that uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and EternalBlue to spread 
    across a network. CoinMiner uses the WMI Standard Event Consumer scripting to execute scripts for persistence. 
    CoinMiner spreads through malspam or is dropped by other malware.
