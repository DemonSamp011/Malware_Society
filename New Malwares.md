# SlothFul-Malware

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) have identified a malware variant — referred to as 
***SLOTHFULMEDIA**** — used by a sophisticated cyber actor. In addition, U.S. Cyber Command has released the malware sample to the malware aggregation tool and repository, VirusTotal.

CISA and CNMF are distributing this Malware Analysis Report (MAR) to enable network defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested response actions 
and recommended mitigation techniques.

The sample is a dropper, which deploys two files when executed. The first is a remote access tool (RAT) named ‘mediaplayer.exe’’, which is designed for command and control (C2) of 
victim computer systems. Analysis has determined the RAT has the ability to terminate processes, run arbitrary commands, take screen shots, modify the registry, and modify files on 
victim machines. It appears to communicate with its C2 controller via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

# Racoon-Malware

A Reason Labs research team has discovered a new variant of the Raccoon malware family. Initially discovered back in 2019, the Raccoon malware family is used to steal confidential data and browser information.

According to the Reason Security report, the new variant masquerades itself as legit, known program installers. The new malware sample flew under the AV radar, says the team, and there were only three minimal detections over two weeks ago. In this article, we analyze this new variant, its attack methods, and disguise techniques. 

The Raccoon malware family is a Trojan that steals user data from about 60 browsers, as well as credentials from various cryptocurrency wallets and the trojan is capable of taking screenshots from the victim machine and capturing input, explains the team. 

The first versions seen, ITW, were written in C++, but a year has gone by and the malware authors have since developed new versions written in Borland Delphi, apparently to make it harder to detect and analyze. The malware comes inside an Inno Setup installer that is responsible for installing both the original program and the malware.

# Clop Ransomware

Ransomware is malware which encrypts your files until you pay a ransom to the hackers. “Clop” is one of the latest and most dangerous ransomware threats. It’s a variant of the well-known CryptoMix ransomware, which frequently targets Windows users.

Before beginning the encryption process, the Clop ransomware blocks over 600 Windows processes and disables multiple Windows 10 applications, including Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials — leaving you with zero chance of protecting your data.

The Clop ransomware has evolved since its inception, now targeting entire networks — not just individual devices. Even the Maastricht University in the Netherlands became a victim of the Clop ransomware, with almost all Windows devices on the university’s network being encrypted and forced to pay a ransom.

# Fake Windows Updates (Hidden Ransomware)

Hackers have been increasingly sending emails that instruct readers to install urgent Windows OS updates. The emails trick readers into installing the “latest” Windows updates, which are actually ransomware ‘.exe’ files in disguise.

The ransomware contained in these emails is known as “Cyborg”. It encrypts all of your files and programs and demands a ransom payment to un-encrypt the files.

Unfortunately, many email service providers and basic antivirus software aren’t able to detect and block these emails. This is why you must be using an antivirus that provides proper internet security, protecting you from dangerous emails.
