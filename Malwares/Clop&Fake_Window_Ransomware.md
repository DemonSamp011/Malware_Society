# Clop Ransomware

Ransomware is malware which encrypts your files until you pay a ransom to the hackers. “Clop” is one of the latest and most dangerous 
ransomware threats. It’s a variant of the well-known CryptoMix ransomware, which frequently targets Windows users.

Before beginning the encryption process, the Clop ransomware blocks over 600 Windows processes and disables multiple Windows 10 
applications, including Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials — leaving you with zero chance of protecting your data.

The Clop ransomware has evolved since its inception, now targeting entire networks — not just individual devices. Even the Maastricht 
University in the Netherlands became a victim of the Clop ransomware, with almost all Windows devices on the university’s network 
being encrypted and forced to pay a ransom.

# Fake Windows Updates (Hidden Ransomware)

Hackers have been increasingly sending emails that instruct readers to install urgent Windows OS updates. The emails trick readers into 
installing the “latest” Windows updates, which are actually ransomware ‘.exe’ files in disguise.

The ransomware contained in these emails is known as “Cyborg”. It encrypts all of your files and programs and demands a ransom payment 
to un-encrypt the files.

Unfortunately, many email service providers and basic antivirus software aren’t able to detect and block these emails. This is why you 
must be using an antivirus that provides proper internet security, protecting you from dangerous emails.
