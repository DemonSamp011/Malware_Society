 Remote Access Tool (RAT) and C2 (Command and control)

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) have identified a malware variant — referred to as 
SLOTHFULMEDIA — used by a sophisticated cyber actor. In addition, U.S. Cyber Command has released 
the malware sample to the malware aggregation tool and repository, VirusTotal.

CISA and CNMF are distributing this Malware Analysis Report (MAR) to enable network defense and 
reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested response actions and recommended 
mitigation techniques.

The sample is a dropper, which deploys two files when executed. The first is a remote access tool 
(RAT) named ‘mediaplayer.exe’’, which is designed for command and control (C2) of victim computer 
systems. Analysis has determined the RAT has the ability to terminate processes, run arbitrary 
commands, take screen shots, modify the registry, and modify files on victim machines. It appears 
to communicate with its C2 controller via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP).

The second file has a random five-character name and deletes the dropper once the RAT has 
persistence. Persistence is achieved through the creation of a service named “Task Frame”, which 
ensures the RAT is loaded after a reboot.

Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity 
to the CISA or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for 
enhanced mitigation. For more information on malicious cyber activity,
