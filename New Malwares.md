# SlothFul-Malware

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) have identified a malware variant — referred to as 
***SLOTHFULMEDIA**** — used by a sophisticated cyber actor. In addition, U.S. Cyber Command has released the malware sample to the malware aggregation tool and repository, VirusTotal.

CISA and CNMF are distributing this Malware Analysis Report (MAR) to enable network defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested response actions 
and recommended mitigation techniques.

The sample is a dropper, which deploys two files when executed. The first is a remote access tool (RAT) named ‘mediaplayer.exe’’, which is designed for command and control (C2) of 
victim computer systems. Analysis has determined the RAT has the ability to terminate processes, run arbitrary commands, take screen shots, modify the registry, and modify files on 
victim machines. It appears to communicate with its C2 controller via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
