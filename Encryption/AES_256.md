AES uses symmetric key encryption, which involves the use of only one secret key to cipher and decipher information.
<br>
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the first and only publicly accessible cipher approved by the US National Security Agency (NSA)
for protecting top secret information. AES was first called Rijndael after its two developers, Belgian cryptographers Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen.
