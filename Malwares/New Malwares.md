# New Update

Dropped – Malware delivered by other malware already on the system, an exploit kit, infected third-party software, or manually by a cyber threat actor. Currently Gh0st is being dropped.

Multiple – Malware that currently favors at least two vectors. ZeuS, CryptoWall, and CoinMiner are currently utilizing multiple vectors. ZeuS is dropped by other malware, but it is also delivered via malvertisement. CoinMiner utilizes the malspam and dropped vectors.

Malspam – Unsolicited emails, which either direct users to malicious web sites or trick users into downloading or opening malware. Top 10 Malware using this technique Dridex, Kovter, NanoCore, Pushdo, Tinba, and Ursnif.

Dridex 
    It is a banking trojan that uses malicious macros in Microsoft Office with either malicious embedded links or attachments. 
    Dridex is disseminated via malspam campaigns.
    
ZeuS 
    It is a modular banking trojan which uses keystroke logging to compromise victim credentials when the user visits a banking 
    website. Since the release of the ZeuS source code in 2011, many other malware variants have adopted parts of it’s codebase, 
    which means that events classified as ZeuS may actually be other malware using parts of the ZeuS code.
    
Kovter 
    It is a fileless click fraud malware and a downloader that evades detection by hiding in registry keys. Reporting indicates 
    that Kovter can have backdoor capabilities and uses hooks within certain APIs for persistence.
    
Gh0st 
    It is a RAT used to control infected endpoints. Gh0st is dropped by other malware to create a backdoor into a device that 
    allows an attacker to fully control the infected device.
    
CryptoWall 
    It is a ransomware commonly distributed through malspam with malicious ZIP attachments, Java Vulnerabilities, and 
    malicious advertisements. Upon successful infection, CryptoWall will scan the system for drive letters, network shares, and 
    removable drives. CryptoWall runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
    
Pushdo 
    It is a botnet that has been active since 2007 and operates as a service for malware and spam distribution. Pushdo is 
    known to distribute the Cutwail spambot. The malware uses encrypted communication channels and domain generation algorithms 
    to send instructions to its zombie hosts.
    
NanoCore 
    It is a RAT spread via malspam as a malicious Excel XLS spreadsheet. As a RAT, NanoCore can accept commands to 
    download and execute files, visit websites, and add registry keys for persistence.
    
Tinba (aka Tiny Banker)
    It is a banking trojan, known for its small file size. Tinba uses web injection to collect victim 
    information from login pages and web forms and is primarily disseminated via exploit kits.
    
Ursnif    
    Ursnif and its variant Dreambot, are banking trojans known for weaponizing documents. Ursnif recently upgraded its 
    web injection attacks to include TLS callbacks in order to obfuscate against anti-malware software. Ursnif collects 
    victim information from login pages and web forms.
    
CoinMiner 
    It is a cryptocurrency miner that uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and EternalBlue to spread 
    across a network. CoinMiner uses the WMI Standard Event Consumer scripting to execute scripts for persistence. 
    CoinMiner spreads through malspam or is dropped by other malware.

# New Malware Threats Identified



**Enhanced Banking Trojan**
- - - -
Trusteer researcher Amit Klein blogged on Feb. 7 about enhancements hackers have made to Tinba - a banking Trojan that began hitting underground forums about eight months ago.

This new version of Tinba has the ability to get around conventional fraud-detection methods, such as those outlined in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's updated authentication guidance, that many banking institutions rely on, Trusteer notes.

A new version of Tinba, Tinba v2, was discovered in early January by Trusteer after one of its bank customers was targeted. Trusteer would not offer details about the bank that was hit, but analysis of the attack revealed Tinba had been enhanced to not only avoid detection, but also compromise two-factor authentication.

"When the customer accesses the bank's website, the malware presents a completely fake web page that looks like the bank login page," Klein says.

Once the user enters his login and password on the fake page, the malware triggers an error message and then sends the online banking credentials to the hacker, Klein says.

Any second-factor verification codes or tokens entered for authentication during the faux session also are compromised.

**DroidCleaner for Mobile**
- - - -
Identified Jan. 22 in the Google Play mobile application store by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, DroidCleaner is marketed by attackers as an app that can free memory on Google's operating system.

The malware takes aim at Android smart phones, as well as PCs. DroidCleaner compromises a mobile device's SD card and contacts list and can even send, delete and upload SMS/text messages. Once a user connects an infected device to a PC, DroidCleaner infects the computer and hijacks the system's microphone for eavesdropping.

"The most concerning thing is the fact that bad guys are using the infected smart phones as a new attack vector, aiming to infect the PC," says Kaspersky researcher Fabio Assolini. "This is a completely new behavior on malicious Droid apps."

The malware's ability to record audio from an infected PC means anytime the PC's microphone is activated, every sound could be recorded, Assolini says. DroidCleaner, however, is not a malware designed specifically for attacks against online-banking.

But the malware has the ability to compromise SMS/texting features often used for out-of-band authentication or verification of online-banking transactions. And any attack against a mobile platform, especially one that can hijack SMS/texting services, poses a risk, Assolini says.

"Online banking using mobile devices is targeted by other known malicious viruses, such as Zeus, SpyEye and Carberp," he says. "The attacks on the Android platform are very common, but with different goals. [This is why] we advise all users to maintain an AV on their device."

PCs running older versions of the Microsoft Windows operating systems are vulnerable, Kaspersky researchers point out. The function that automatically allowed the malware to be installed has been disabled on current versions, they note. So the PC piece of the attack is aimed only at users using older versions of Windows.
