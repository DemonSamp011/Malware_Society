Trusteer researcher Amit Klein blogged on Feb. 7 about enhancements hackers have made to Tinba - a banking Trojan that began 
hitting underground forums about eight months ago.

This new version of Tinba has the ability to get around conventional fraud-detection methods, such as those outlined in the 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's updated authentication guidance, that many banking institutions rely on, 
Trusteer notes.

A new version of Tinba, Tinba v2, was discovered in early January by Trusteer after one of its bank customers was targeted. 
Trusteer would not offer details about the bank that was hit, but analysis of the attack revealed Tinba had been enhanced to 
not only avoid detection, but also compromise two-factor authentication.

"When the customer accesses the bank's website, the malware presents a completely fake web page that looks like the bank 
login page," Klein says.

Once the user enters his login and password on the fake page, the malware triggers an error message and then sends the online 
banking credentials to the hacker, Klein says.

Any second-factor verification codes or tokens entered for authentication during the faux session also are compromised.
