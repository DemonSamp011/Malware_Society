# Malware!

Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious
software, malware typically consists 
of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network. Malware 
is typically delivered in the form 
of a link or file over email and requires the user to click on the link or open the file to execute the malware.
Malware has actually been a threat to individuals and organizations since the early 1970s when the Creeper virus first appeared. Since then, the 
world has been under attack from 
hundreds of thousands of different malware variants, all with the intent of causing the most disruption and damage as possible.


# [1] ⚠️List of terms used in the field of hacking.⚠️

🚩Adware − Adware is software designed to force pre-chosen ads to display on your system.

🚩Attack − An attack is an action that is done on a system to get its access and extract sensitive data.

🚩Back door − A back door, or trap door, is a hidden entry to a computing device or software that bypasses security measures, such as logins and 
password protections.

🚩Bot − A bot is a program that automates an action so that it can be done repeatedly at a much higher rate for a more sustained period than a 
human operator could do it. For example, sending HTTP, FTP or Telnet at a higher rate or calling script to create objects at a higher rate.

🚩Botnet − A botnet, also known as zombie army, is a group of computers controlled without their owners’ knowledge. Botnets are used to send spam 
or make denial of service attacks.

🚩Brute force attack − A brute force attack is an automated and the simplest kind of method to gain access to a system or website. It tries different 
combination of usernames and passwords, over and over again, until it gets in.

🚩Buffer Overflow − Buffer Overflow is a flaw that occurs when more data is written to a block of memory, or buffer, than the buffer is allocated 
to hold.

🚩Clone phishing − Clone phishing is the modification of an existing, legitimate email with a false link to trick the recipient into providing 
personal information.

🚩Cracker − A cracker is one who modifies the software to access the features which are considered undesirable by the person cracking the software, 
especially copy protection features.

🚩Denial of service attack (DoS) − A denial of service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to make a server or a network resource unavailable to users, 
usually by temporarily interrupting or suspending the services of a host connected to the Internet.

🚩DDoS − Distributed denial of service attack.

🚩Exploit Kit − An exploit kit is software system designed to run on web servers, with the purpose of identifying software vulnerabilities in client 
machines communicating with it and exploiting discovered vulnerabilities to upload and execute malicious code on the client.

🚩Exploit − Exploit is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to compromise 
the security of a computer or network system.

🚩Firewall − A firewall is a filter designed to keep unwanted intruders outside a computer system or network while allowing safe communication between 
systems and users on the inside of the firewall.

🚩Keystroke logging − Keystroke logging is the process of tracking the keys which are pressed on a computer (and which touchscreen points are used). 
It is simply the map of a computer/human interface. It is used by gray and black hat hackers to record login IDs and passwords. Keyloggers are usually 
secreted onto a device using a Trojan delivered by a phishing email.

🚩Logic bomb − A virus secreted into a system that triggers a malicious action when certain conditions are met. The most common version is the time bomb.

🚩Malware − Malware is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, Trojan 
horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs.

🚩Master Program − A master program is the program a black hat hacker uses to remotely transmit commands to infected zombie drones, normally to carry out 
Denial of Service attacks or spam attacks.

🚩Phishing − Phishing is an e-mail fraud method in which the perpetrator sends out legitimate-looking emails, in an attempt to gather personal and 
financial information from recipients.

🚩Phreaker − Phreakers are considered the original computer hackers and they are those who break into the telephone network illegally, typically to make 
free longdistance phone calls or to tap phone lines.


# [2] Tips To Help Protect Your Devices Against Ransomware Attacks

1.	Install and use trusted security software on all your devices, including your mobile phone.
2.	Keep your security software up to date. It can help protect your devices against cyber-attacks.
3.	Update your operating system and other software. This can patch security vulnerabilities.
4.	Avoid reflexively opening email attachments. Why? Email is one of the principal methods for delivering ransomware. 
5.	Be wary of any email attachment that advises you to enable macros to view its content. If you enable macros, macro malware can infect multiple files.
6.	Back up your data to an external hard drive. If you’re the victim of a ransomware attack, you’ll likely be able to restore your files once the malware 
has been cleaned up.
7.	Consider utilizing cloud services. This can help mitigate a ransomware infection, since many cloud services retain previous versions of files, allowing 
you to “roll back” to the unencrypted form.
8.	Don’t pay the ransom. You could pay a ransom in hopes of getting your files back — but you might not get them back. There’s no guarantee the cybercriminal 
will release your data.
9.	Encryption is essential to help protect your sensitive personal information. But in the case of ransomware attacks, it can be used against you. 
It’s smart to take steps to help you gain the benefits and avoid the harm.


# [3] Types of Hiding Virus
1.	Binder
It is used to bind or collaborate the server and virus that has been created. So if anyone opens the image or songs to get open and start working in 
background.
2.	Crypter
It basically a tool used for changing binary code of the .exe files and applies many encryptions on it to make it undetectable.
3.	Zipping
In this method you have to put your server and virus and make it in a zip file, it will change extension from .exe to .zip which bypasses the file 
transfer facility.
{Note: Using WinRAR provides that file with a password and antivirus won’t be able to detect it.}
4.	Extension
It basically changes the extension of the file from .exe or .bat file to .png, .jpg, .jpeg and etc. and then sends it to the user but the user need to 
rename the extension to .exe file for the virus/server to perform.


# [4] 🔰 Some Ethical Hacking Terminologies 🔰

Phreaker − Phreakers are considered the original computer hackers and they are those who break into the telephone network illegally, typically to make 
free longdistance phone calls or to tap phone lines.

Rootkit − Rootkit is a stealthy type of software, typically malicious, designed to hide the existence of certain processes or programs from normal 
methods of detection and enable continued privileged access to a computer.

Shrink Wrap code − A Shrink Wrap code attack is an act of exploiting holes in unpatched or poorly configured software.

Social engineering − Social engineering implies deceiving someone with the purpose of acquiring sensitive and personal information, like credit card 
details or user names and passwords.

# [5] 🔰 WHAT IS A CRYPTOR ? 🔰

Crypter is a type of software that can encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate malware, to make it harder to detect by security programs. It is used by cybercriminals to create malware that can bypass security programs by presenting itself as a harmless program until it gets installed. Types of crypters.

# [6] JOCKER Malware

The Joker malware steals money from the users by subscribing them to paid subscriptions without the client consent. It first stimulates interaction with ads without users’ knowledge and them steals the victim’s SMS messages including bank OTP to authenticate payments. 

*Joker trojan* has found its way to **Google Play** store once again. Last year, as well as earlier this year in February the Joker malware infected several apps which later Google removed from the Play store. The malware has yet again made its way to the Play store and affected some apps which could be installed on your phone. Google has removed as many as *11 apps* from the Play store. 

 The infected apps include: 

**1. com.imagecompress.android**

**2. com.relax.relaxation.androidsms**

**3. com.cheery.message.sendsms**

**4. com.peason.lovinglovemessage** 

**5. com.contact.withme.texts**

**6. com.hmvoice.friendsms**

**7. com.file.recovefiles**

**8. com.LPlocker.lockapps**

**9. com.remindme.alram**

**10. com.training.memorygame**

The **Joker malware** steals money from users by subscribing them to paid subscriptions without their consent. It first simulates interaction with ads without users’ knowledge and then steals the **victim’s SMS messages including OTP** to authenticate payments. 

This means that the affected user might not know that they have been **signed up** for a paid subscription service and that their money has been deducted from their account unless they receive a message or notification stating their credit card statements, etc. 

According to Check Point, “Joker keeps finding its way into Google’s official application market as a result of small changes to its code, which enables it to get past the Play store’s security and vetting barriers.” This time two new variants of the Joker Dropper and Premium Dialer spyware have been discovered in the Play Store. These were found hiding inside of some “seemingly legitimate apps”. 

The report stated that this time the malicious actor behind Joker “adopted an old technique from the conventional PC threat landscape and used it in the mobile app world to avoid detection by Google.” 

The time Joker malware used two components – “Notification Listener service that is part of the original application, and a dynamic dex file loaded from the C&C server to perform the registration of the user to the services.” 

The report further stated, “In an attempt to minimize Joker’s fingerprint, the actor behind it hid the dynamically loaded dex file from sight while still ensuring it is able to load – a technique which is well-known to developers of malware for Windows PCs. This new variant now hides the malicious dex file inside the application as Base64 encoded strings, ready to be decoded and loaded.” 

If you have any of the aforementioned apps on your smartphone delete them immediately. 

Check Point suggests that you must uninstall infected applications from your device and also check your mobile and credit-card bills to check if you have been signed up for any subscriptions and unsubscribe. To prevent Joker malware from affecting in the future you must install a security solution into your device. 


# New Malware Discovered in 2020

***1. Brookfield (August 2020)***
**#ContiRansomware #Ryuk**

The first on our list of recent ransomware attacks in 2020 comes to us from the north side of the border. Darkside, a new ransomware group, claims to have carried out a ransomware attack against Brookfield Residential Properties, which is based in Calgary, Canada. ITWorldCanada reports that the company, a division of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., admitted to them that an unspecified data security incident took place. However, it didn’t verify whether the attack involved ransomware or DarkSide.

***2. R1 RCM Medical Debt Collections Firm (August 2020)***

In August, KrebsOnSecurity reported that the R1 RCM Inc. was hit by a ransomware attack.R1 RCM Inc. chose to not disclose the type of ransomware that was used in the attack, nor provide other details about the compromise, including which systems or data may have been compromised. However, KrebsOnSecurity reports that the attack used the Defray ransomware. Trend Micro describes Defray as a type of targeted ransomware that’s typically spread via phishing emails.

***3. The City of Lafayette, Colorado (July 2020)***

The city of Lafayette announced in August that they paid $45,000 to ransomware operators after their devices and data became encrypted via ransomware on July 27. The payment was made to receive a decryption key after the city was unable to restore systems from their backups. They chose to go the ransom payment route because it seemed like a less costly and more convenient solution to minimize lengthy service outages for residents.

Although they didn’t specify the type of ransomware that was involved, the city’s notice about the outage shared that the ransomware disabled the city’s network systems. This impacted everything from online payment systems to email and phone services (but thankfully not the 9-1-1 and emergency dispatch systems, though). The results of their initial investigation points to a phishing scam or potential brute force attack for the cause of the ransomware attack.

***4. University of Utah (July 2020)***

The University of Utah (UofU) recently found itself in the crosshairs of one of the latest ransomware attacks on a higher ed institution. They released a statement about the attack, stating that their computing servers were targeted in an unspecified ransomware attack that affected approximately 0.02% of the data on those servers. Although the university used their data backups to restore some of its services and systems, they still chose to pay the $457,059.24 ransom.

***5. Columbia College Chicago (June 2020)***

This brings us to No. 5 on our list of recent ransomware attacks: Columbia College Chicago. The Illinois institution was targeted by the NetWalker ransomware gang, who threatened to sell students’ data on the dark web if no extortion payment was made within six days.

NetWalker, also known as Mailto, is a ransomware strain that’s thought to have made its criminal debut in August 2019. ZDNet reports that the NetWalker closed-access ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) portal — which other hackers can use after undergoing a vetting process — launches specialized attacks against high-value targets. It’s thought to have helped the NetWalker ransomware operators rake in $25 million since March 2020 alone.

***6. University of California, San Francisco (June 2020)***

However, Columbia College Chicago wasn’t the NetWalker ransomware’s only recent target. Two other institutions — University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Michigan State University — were also victimized by the same family of ransomware. (More on MSU shortly.)

On June 1, the university’s IT staff spotted and halted unauthorized access of the medical school’s IT environment. They began working with a cybersecurity firm and were able to determine that most of the school’s IT environment was unaffected. ZDNet reports that UCSF opted to pay the $1.14 million negotiated ransom demand to the attackers to recover data that the attackers encrypted.

***7. Michigan State University (May 2020)***

MLive reports that Michigan State University was hit with the NetWalker ransomware. In their demand, the ransomware operators said the university had one week to pay a ransom in exchange for access to their encrypted files. Otherwise, the attackers said they’d leak the personal and banking related data of MSU students.

The attack, which is said to have taken place on Memorial Day, was reportedly limited to affecting systems for the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Unlike UCSF, the Michigan university opted to not pay the ransom, saying that they were heeding the advice of law enforcement.
This incident was followed by the discovery of a data breach that involved MSU’s online store. MSUToday reports that the names, addresses and credit card numbers of around 2,600 customers was exposed as the result of a website vulnerability. The period of exposure was said to have been between Oct. 19, 2019 and June 26, 2020

***8. Blackbaud (May 2020)***

Blackbaud, the major cloud computing provider for many commercial and non-profit entities, was the target of a ransomware attack in May. (UCSF and MSU were among the educational institutions affected by the incident because they use Blackbaud as a vendor for their philanthropic tracking activities.)

The company was able to discover and disrupt the attack, ultimately blocking them from their systems. However, they weren’t able to do so before the attackers successfully removed some data.

***9. Grubman, Shire, Meiselas & Sacks Law Firm (May 2020)***

Although we’ve already talked about this situation in our list of the top cyber security statistics for 2020, it’s definitely worth including on the list of the latest ransomware attacks. In May, Page Six reported that a hacker group that goes by the name REvil set their sights on the A-list law firm Grubman, Shire, Meiselas & Sacks. REvil used the Sodinokibi ransomware to carry out their attack.

Initially, the attackers demanded a payment of $21 million to prevent the disclosure of 756 GB of confidential client data. However, they doubled the demand to $42 million when the law firm refused to cough up the payment. They’ve since released data relating to several celebrities, including Madonna and Lady Gaga, and said that they plan to auction off more data.

***10. Cognizant (April 2020)***

Cognizant, a Fortune 500 company that provides IT services to companies across a variety of industries, shared in April that they were the target of a ransomware attack. The attack, which affected their internal systems and involved the deletion of their internal directory, also disrupted services to their customers.
