The increasing sophistication of malware attacks means finding and removing them can be harder than ever. 

Many malware programs start out as a trojan horse or worm and then add the victim's computer to a botnet, letting the attacker into the victim's computer and network.

If you're lucky, you can see the malware executables in your active processes but as we know the rise of fileless malware is making this more difficult. 

Unfortunately, finding and removing is becoming more difficult because you may never know the extent of the infection. Often you're better off backing up any data and
reimaging the computer. 

Prevention is key. Keep your systems patched, continuously monitor for vulnerabilities and educate your staff on the dangers of executing attachments and programs from 
suspicious emails. And remember, third-party risk and fourth-party risk exist. 

You need to make sure your third-party risk management framework and vendor risk management program forces your vendors to keep their systems secure and free of malware 
like you do. Customers don't care whether it was you or your vendors who caused a data breach or data leak. Don't join our list of the biggest data breaches.
