<p>
Previously unknown ransomware dubbed Pay2Key, carries targeted attacks against Israeli companies
Initial infection is presumably made through RDP connection
Lateral movement is made using psexec.exe to execute the ransomware on the different machines within the organization.
Special attention was given to the design of the network communication, in order to reduce the noise a large number of encrypted machines may generate while contacting the Command and Control servers.
The encryption scheme is solid – using the AES and RSA algorithms.

Attacks Timeline
During the last days, we were able to obtain bits and pieces of information as well as various forensics artifacts from Israeli Incident Response teams, indicating that a new ransomware strain is being deployed against Israeli corporations (perhaps exclusively).

<pre>
Combining these elements, we were able to bring together a partial image of the attacks as they unfolded:

2020-06-28 – The attacker created a KeyBase account by the name of “pay2key”
2020-10-26 – First ransomware sample compilation date
2020-10-27 – Second ransomware sample compilation date
2020-10-27 – First Pay2Key sample uploaded to VT and compiled on the same day – may indicate its first appearance in the wild.
2020-10-28 – Second ransomware sample uploaded to VT – Indicating a possible attacked organization.
2020-11-01 – Third sample compilation date
2020-11-01 – The first reported attack (Sunday; working day in Israel)
2020-11-02 – The second reported attack
</pre>

The Pay2Key propagation appears to be conducted as follows:

Right after midnight, the attackers connected to a machine on the targeted network most probably via RDP.
A machine is defined as Pivot / Proxy point within the network, likely by using a program named “ConnectPC.exe”. All outgoing communication between all ransomware processes within the network and the attacker’s C&C server will be going through this proxy from this point on.
The attacker used psexec.exe to execute “Cobalt.Client.exe”, which is the Pay2Key ransomware itself, on different machines within the organization.

# Notes:
1. RDP: <br>
      “The Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provides remote display and input capabilities over network connections for Windows-based applications running on a server.”         (MSDN) Essentially, RDP allows users to control their remote Windows machine as if they were working on it locally (well, almost).
      
2. psexec.exe <br>
      PsExec or psexec.exe is a command-line utility built for Windows. It allows administrators to run programs on local and more commonly remote computers. It is a free             utility part of the Sysinternals pstools suite built by Mark Russinovich many years ago
      
3. RSA and AES Cryptography
