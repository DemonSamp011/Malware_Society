1.	Install and use trusted security software on all your devices, including your mobile phone.
2.	Keep your security software up to date. It can help protect your devices against cyber-attacks.
3.	Update your operating system and other software. This can patch security vulnerabilities.
4.	Avoid reflexively opening email attachments. Why? Email is one of the principal methods for delivering ransomware. 
5.	Be wary of any email attachment that advises you to enable macros to view its content. If you enable macros, macro malware can infect multiple files.
6.	Back up your data to an external hard drive. If you’re the victim of a ransomware attack, you’ll likely be able to restore your files once the malware 
    has been cleaned up.
7.	Consider utilizing cloud services. This can help mitigate a ransomware infection, since many cloud services retain previous versions of files, allowing 
    you to “roll back” to the unencrypted form.
8.	Don’t pay the ransom. You could pay a ransom in hopes of getting your files back — but you might not get them back. There’s no guarantee the cybercriminal 
    will release your data.
9.	Encryption is essential to help protect your sensitive personal information. But in the case of ransomware attacks, it can be used against you. 
    It’s smart to take steps to help you gain the benefits and avoid the harm.
